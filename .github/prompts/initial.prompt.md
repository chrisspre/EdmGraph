you are going to create a "labeled property graph" structure in c#
Create types for node, edge, each with a string Label and a Dictionary<string,object> Properties. 
Nodes are going to be modeled with directional adjaceny lists of edges. 

Add a Graph class that holds a list of nodes and edges as well as a "index" by label and offers convenience methods to construct nodes and edges and traverse (single step) them.
